On March 27, 2022, I had just finished writing my first two pages for my Information Systems college thesis.

It was a cloudy day. It was calm and a bit monotonous, just like every Sunday. I had reserved my whole afternoon to do the first pages of the thesis, but I finished it early, in only two hours, so I had the rest of the afternoon free.

It was after buying a chocolate bar at the pharmacy that an idea came to me: "What if I wrote an article about camera positioning and post it on the DYOM forum? This idea comes up most likely because I had watched several videos on cinematography last night.

And while I was writing and doing my research for the article, I came across DYOM IX version 3.1, one of my favorites because it added the Zoom feature and cutscene camera lens adjustment. I started writing about Darkmorgan's disappearance and the hiatus that DYOM IX development was on at the time, and then I thought, "OK, maybe I'm deviating a bit from the main topic..."

And soon after I came across a research on what people consider as art and what they don't. The result of the survey was interesting and I started to write a little bit about it in the same text file and, I thought, "Now I'm definitely losing focus".

But that didn't discourage me from writing the article, what happened was that I thought that instead of writing just one, maybe I could do it weekly, and then create a journal with news about the DYOM community, quest reviews, and other things that I can think of.

The problem was that for a long time I didn't know exactly what this journal would look like, or better yet, even today I don't know very well what the articles will look like from now on. I can say that I have many articles already written, ready to be revised and then posted. It is uncertain, however, the main purpose of this journal, because sometimes it is an almost journalistic work with robust data and sources, sometimes it is a short article to interact with the community, or sometimes I write just to vent and say what comes up in my mind,

Perhaps uncertainty and unpredictability is the essence of this journal.
