# Cameras

## The movement

Cinematic works embody every art form known to mankind. A vast amount of work is required to produce a motion picture: the writing of the script, the visual effects, the sound and music, the acting, and countless others things.

So, try to think, what would be the most important element in the creation of a film?

If your answer was the plot, the sets, the dialogues, or even the camera &mdash; the theme of this post &mdash;, these would be great answers and are, in fact, very necessary elements for the creation of a quality film. There is, however, a somewhat subjective element that makes movies stand out from other art forms: **the movement.**[^movement]

In film we find two types of movement

1. The **physical movement** of the camera and the objects in the scene
2. The **"emotional movement"**.

In this post we will stick only to the physical movement, because we will talk about how cameras work in movies.

The emotional movement, usually created during the writing of the script, will be left for another post, but I emphasize that it is also a fundamental element for a good film.

## Where DYOM could improve?

I know, we get a lot of complaints about what could be added or fixed in DYOM, but for me, one of the features I would most like to see in this modification would be a total overhaul and improvement in how the cameras work.

There is so much that can be done with a camera that it is frustrating to be limited to just the current options.

## Camera features

To produce a scene, we use the camera, and in it we have some techniques that can improve the look of our scene.[^camera]

### Framing

Framing is when we position and insert personages and objects in a scene.

A common example is **"Over the Shoulder (OTS)"** framing, where, during a conversation, the camera is positioned behind an off-screen actor, while the camera focuses on the on-screen actor.

!["Establishing shot"](https://nofilmschool.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_wide/public/bbcenterfinal.jpg?itok=PzzNFVfz)

The **"Establishing shot"**, usually used in the opening of a scene, which aims to show where the scene is located, and can also show the relationship between people and objects.

There are other framing possibilities. This article covers very well all forms of framing.

Virtually all framing techniques are possible to recreate in DYOM, except one: the **Point of View (POV).**

In many cases you will be able to recreate the POV, remember that we have the tool to position the camera in first person for both the actors and the player, but there is one specificity that is not possible to recreate in DYOM. Take a look at the following image:

![Binoculars](https://mobilemoviemaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/binoculars.jpg)

In the scene, POV framing is used. And what indicates this use to us is the overlay of the binoculars' view. In DYOM, **there is no way to draw overlays on the camera**, and it is impossible to make a POV of a sniper, a photographer, or anything like that.

### Angles

Most angles can be recreated in DYOM, but some of the more specific and advanced ones are impossible to replicate with this camera. One such technique is the **Dutch Angle** (or Dutch Tilt) where the camera tilts to one side, causing a sense of disorientation.

![Dutch Angle](https://853850.smushcdn.com/1835671/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/What-is-Dutch-Angle.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)

Personally, this angle is one of my favorites for causing a feeling that something is out of order or that an action is about to happen, but unfortunately, **this effect is not possible in DYOM** and this is a little frustrating as it makes the scene a little less exciting than it could be.

### Motion

**Camera movement** is a powerful feature in filmmaking employed to modify the relationship between the subject and the camera view in order to alter the audience's perspective of space and time for more impactful storytelling.

This is where DYOM definitely shows a lack of resources for cutscenes.

Making a creative or memorable cutscene is an extremely dicey task, and on many occasions impossible.

To create a moving cutscene, you need to create a static zero-second cutscene and then a smooth/linear cutscene. And at each change of angle and direction we have to repeat the process of inserting a new smooth/linear cutscene. And at each cutscene we have a delay of a few milliseconds which is often noticeable and makes the cutscene strange.

There could be a system just like the actors' routepoints, but for cutscenes.

## A possible solution

When I started writing this article, DYOM IX was on a hiatus due to the disappearance of its initial developer, Darkmorgan. Then Halter took over the leadership of the project and fortunately we have a light at the end of the tunnel for implementing new features and fixing bugs for DYOM.

The latest version published by Darkmorgan in late 2021, **DYOM IX 3.1** gave some hope for the camera to be improved, as it added some very important features like Zoom-In/Zoom-Out and changing the focal lens size of the camera.[^ix]

Due to the limitation of GTA San Andreas itself, it would be complicated to ask for the camera to be reworked in DYOM IX, so I can't say what would be the proper solution to this problem. But I hope this article will inspire Halter and other add-ons developers to come up with something to improve the cameras.

## Final Considerations

There were many things I wanted to talk about in this article, as it was the first article I started writing that gave birth to this project.

As I said before, when I started writing this article, in late March, DYOM IX was still stuck in version 3.1, which made me write a few paragraphs about, but I had to delete them to update the file. I also switched software several times to write the articles. I tried to make a single website for the journal, but almost a month later I decided it was better to post them on the forum anyway.

Anyway, there were many counterpoints and I believe that the quality of this article may not have been very good.

Hope you had a good read, see you in the next week ;)
